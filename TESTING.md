## Validation

I used PEP8 to validate the code. No errors were found, only minor remarks about spacing and line lenghts.
For example, some inline comments needed more indentation and some lines were too long (in the code, not in the actual program's output). I addressed all these and the reading now comes back completely clean.

## Manual Testing

__Systems Tested__

* Ubuntu
* Windows 10 & 11

__Browsers Tested__
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Brave
* Microsoft Edge

### Testing User Stories

__First Time Visitors__

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| --- | --- |
| The game should be easy to understand | The simple rules of the game are explained in the "How to play" section found on the main menu. |
| All instructions should be clear and simple | All essential text is concise and free from big words, options are repeated to the player when relevant. |
| I should be able to mess around without breaking the program | The game handles bad input without problems and does not break if played the wrong way. |
| I should always know what input is expected and why my input gets rejected | The game always reminds the player of what to type. |

__Returning Visitors__

|  Goals | How are they achieved? |
| --- | --- |
| The game should not be a mere repetition of a set sequence of questions | The game features more than twice as many questions as the number asked in a round of the game. Each round uses a random selection of these in a random order. |
| The game should keep track of results and let me look at the scoreboard | Scores are tracked on an external spreadsheet so that it cannot be tampered with or accidentally reset between sessions. The scoreboard persists and it's the same scoreboard for everyone.|
| Program feedback should not be dull and boring | The game will randomly select and combine pieces of feedback for a more human, entertaining feel. |

### Solved Bugs

1. The game would sometimes crash when trying to load high scores if there were few or no entries in the list.
2. Names in the first place of the scoreboard would lose their first letter when loaded into the game.
3. Highscores would be reset when refreshing the page

### Unfixed Bugs

There is one annoying bug in this program, which lets impatient users input their answers while the program is still printing the questions. The program keeps the input buffered and handles it when the input prompt appears. I used a variety of solutions for this (some of which can be seen by looking at older deployments here at GitHub), but all had drawbacks that were ultimately worse than the original bug. For example, using getpass had a nearly ideal result except for the fact that it rendered all input invisible.

Proper solutions require multiple imports and dependencies which are system specific, and I'd need to make sure the dependencies come through to the deployed project at heroku. And some linux builds will completely reject any attempt to mess with inputs. There are so many factors that simply cannot be tested within the context of this small project made for a Code Institute assignment.

After a lot of Googling and asking around in the Code Institute's Slack room, I could not find any feasible solutions. Other people had the same issue, and I was told it was not a big deal. So, during my final mentoring session for the project, I was recommended to go back to regular input prompts and just explain the nature of this bug here.

In the future, I will sort it out.
