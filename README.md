## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

## How to Play

The quiz game is quite straightforward. The game presents a question and four alternatives to choose from. The player inputs their selection, and the game checks if it is correct. If it is correct, the game increments the player's score. Otherwise, the player is told that the answer is incorrect.

WHen the game is over, the player can choose to start over from the beginning or quit. If their score is good enough, it will appear on the list of high scores.

## Development Process

Before I began building the project, I made a flowchart to visualize how the program will operate. This flowchart not only helped to determine the order of operations for the program itself, but also gave myself clear directions on where to start and the general sequence of building it.

3. Click the settings button.
4. In the left sidebar, select "pages".
5. From the source dropdown select main branch and click save.
6. The site is now deployed, although it might take a few minutes before the site is live.

### Local Development
